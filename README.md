# EtherLuxe DAO

Game-focused marketplace and decentralized autonomous organization that allows users to manage in-game content.

## About

The concept of the project is related to the implementation of allowing users to participate in the process of adding new game elements. At the initial stage, the user can buy an NFT character on the marketplace and receive tokens along with the in-game NFT governess tokens that give the right to participate in voting.

### Scheme for obtaining governance tokens when buying NFT

### Basic project configuration:

- 3 collection contracts (Characters, Vehicles, Weapons)
- in each collection there is a basic type of NFT (kind 0)
- sale contract in which one governance collection (characters) and one non-governance collection (weapons) are added
- oracle contract, which is responsible for the user's purchase of NFT
- Aragon DAO for voting

Votings are created by the platform administrator and the following options are available in the presented MVP:

- Adding new nft types to existing collections
- Adding new collections to the sale contract
- Changed the governanceTokensInvariant attribute, which affects the number of government tokens received when buying NFT in a collection that is added as CollectionGovernance
- Mint additional governance tokens

## Technical design

### Smart contracts

The main idea and the key part of the project are the Solidity smart contracts used to implement the Gamefi parts, which are represented by collection contracts, the sale contract and the [Aragon OSx](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/) DAO functionality.

### Backend

Built using the Django web framework, which is a popular Python-based tool for building web applications. For building RESTful APIs, the Django Rest Framework (DRF) has been utilized to simplify the process of building APIs and make them more modular and scalable.

### Frontend

DApp has been built with ReactJS, a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This enables the application to provide a more responsive, dynamic and interactive user experience.

## How to run

### Contracts deploy

Deploy Aragon DAO

Clone repo and go to the `contracts` directory
export envs for deploy contracts:

``` bash
export MNEMONIC=<mnemonic phrase>
export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<polygonscan api key>
export MUMBAI_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
export GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<aragon governance token address>
```

``` bash
yarn
# deploy oracle
yarn hardhat deploy --network mumbai --tags SaleContractOracle
# deploy sale contract
yarn hardhat deploy --network mumbai --tags SaleContract
# deploy collections(characters, transports, weapons)
yarn hardhat deploy --network mumbai --tags EtherLuxeCollectionCharacters,EtherLuxeCollectionTransports,EtherLuxeCollectionWeapons
# add base collections kind
yarn hardhat deploy --network mumbai --tags AddBaseKind
# add collections to the sale contract
yarn hardhat deploy --network mumbai --tags AddCollections
# verify contracts 
yarn hardhat etherscan-verify --network mumbai --api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

### Run project in docker

export envs

```bash
export SECRET_KEY=<django secret key>
export DB_HOST=api_db
export DB_PASSWORD=<db password>

export SALE_CONTRACT=<sale contract address>
export ORACLE_CONTRACT=<oracle contract address>
export ORACLE_WORKER_PRIVATE_KEY=<private key of wallet with oracle worker role>
export PURCHASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=<private key of wallet with purchase admin role>
export REACT_APP_IPFS_API_KEY=<ipfs api key>
```

deploy on host:
